                        <p class="description">
                            Hello! I’m Elliot, and I live in Italy. I’ve always been fascinated by technology and its potential to change the world. When I’m not diving into tech projects, you might find me strumming my guitar, challenging others to a game of chess, or solving a Rubik’s Cube. I also enjoy playing specific video games and listening to a variety of good music. These hobbies are just a few of the main parts of my day.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
                        <p class="description">
                            This website explores artificial intelligence, delving into its history, current developments, and future potential. I aim to cover every aspect of AI, from its foundational concepts to its most advanced applications, highlighting how it will transform the world. My goal is to provide reliable information that helps everyone—from experts to beginners—understand what AI is and its implications for society.
                        </p>

                        <h3>History Background</h3>
                        <p class="description">
                            This website is the result of a passion for technology, creativity, and a love for learning. My journey started with a deep fascination for Artificial Intelligence, which inspired me to explore the endless possibilities of coding and software development. As I began to dive deeper into web development, I taught myself HTML and CSS, building small projects along the way to hone my skills.
                        </p>
                        <p class="description">
                            Along the way, I explored tools like WordPress, which offers a user-friendly way to create websites. While it provided a great foundation, I felt drawn to go further—moving beyond templates and discovering the power of writing code from scratch. This shift allowed me to better understand how websites are built and gave me the flexibility to create custom solutions, diving deeper into the craft of web development.
                        </p>
                        <p class="description">
                            With a growing passion for coding, I’ve made it my mission to understand the intricacies of software and web development. I’m excited to continue learning and experimenting, constantly exploring new tools and techniques to improve and refine my skills.
                        </p>
                        <p class="description">
                            While my primary focus has been on the frontend, I have a solid foundation in backend development, including extensive knowledge of computer science and databases. I’m familiar with a variety of tools and programming languages, which allows me to tackle tasks ranging from simple to complex. This blend of expertise enables me to create a comprehensive platform for sharing insights and information about AI. As I continue to expand my knowledge in the field of computer science, I look forward to developing more sophisticated and innovative projects, fueled by my limitless imagination.
                        </p>
